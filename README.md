## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

### What is Medical Image Processing and Classification?

Medical image processing and classification involve the use of various image processing algorithms to analyze and interpret medical images such as CT scans, MRIs, X-rays, and more. These techniques are crucial in the medical field for tasks like tumor detection, disease diagnosis, and treatment planning.

> **ðŸ’¡ Did you know?**
> Medical imaging has revolutionized healthcare by enabling non-invasive diagnostics and precise treatment planning.

### Why Python?

Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It has become the go-to language for data analysis, machine learning, and computer vision due to its extensive libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV.

```python
import numpy as np

# Example: Creating a 2D array
array = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(array)
