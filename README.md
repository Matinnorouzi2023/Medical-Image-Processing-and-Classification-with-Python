### Why Python?

Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It has become the go-to language for data analysis, machine learning, and computer vision due to its extensive libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV.

```python
import numpy as np

# Example: Creating a 2D array
array = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(array)
