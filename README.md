üåü Introduction
What is Medical Image Processing and Classification?
Medical image processing and classification involve the use of various image processing algorithms to analyze and interpret medical images such as CT scans, MRIs, X-rays, and more. These techniques are crucial in the medical field for tasks like tumor detection, disease diagnosis, and treatment planning.

üí° Did you know?
Medical imaging has revolutionized healthcare by enabling non-invasive diagnostics and precise treatment planning. 

Why Python?
Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It has become the go-to language for data analysis, machine learning, and computer vision due to its extensive libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV.

# Example: Building a simple CNN
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
ü©∫ Medical Imaging Modalities
X-ray Images
X-rays are widely used for diagnosing fractures, infections, and lung conditions like pneumonia. They provide a 2D view of internal structures.

CT Scans
Computed Tomography (CT) scans generate cross-sectional images of the body, offering detailed views of bones, blood vessels, and soft tissues.

MRI Images
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of organs and tissues, especially useful for brain and spinal cord examinations.

üìÅ Medical Image Formats
DICOM Format
The DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format is the standard for storing and transmitting medical images. It includes metadata such as patient information and imaging parameters.
